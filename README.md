# Postman playground

This is a simple project to test and learn about the Postman application. 
The project was build using the Symfony Docker template you can check it out [here](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker).

## Getting Started

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
2. If not already done, [install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
3. Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:mariuspop86/postman-playground.git`
4. Navigate to the project folder `cd postman-playground`
5. Run `make build up` to start the project (stop all other containers that might be running)
6. Open Postman and import the collection from the [assets/postman](assets/postman) folder

At this point you should be able to make requests to the API using Postman.
